# Predictive Maintenance API for Industrial Equipment
The Predictive Maintenance API is an advanced AI-powered solution for monitoring, analyzing, and predicting failures in industrial equipment. By integrating IoT sensors and ERP systems, this API processes real-time data to detect anomalies and predict failures before they happen, reducing maintenance costs and downtime.

✨ Key Features:
✅ Real-Time Monitoring – Collect and analyze sensor data such as temperature, vibration, and energy consumption.
✅ AI-Powered Failure Prediction – Machine learning algorithms detect patterns and anticipate mechanical failures.
✅ Detailed Reports – Generate insights and statistics for each piece of equipment via API.
✅ Custom Configuration – Adjust thresholds and limits based on your operational needs.
✅ Seamless Integration – Compatible with ERP systems and industrial platforms.
✅ Secure Authentication – API key-based access for enhanced security.
